<tr><td>blank - Do Not Cancel</td></tr><tr><td>I - Prorate As Is. Prorate as originally expected, based on what the Qty Needed was originally.  Keep the same recipe. This option is not recommended if the Ordered quantity of the parent is expected to be changed. (Example:10 parent items are ordered.  The recipe is that 2 each were originally expected to be shipped per parent quantity. 6 are shipped before the cancel. The cost of the 6 will be applied to only the first 3 parent products received. If the receipt is for more than the 3, the cost gets averaged across the receipt quantity.)</td></tr><tr><td>C - Recalculate Proration. Recalculate the proration based on what the Qty Ship is.  Recalculate the recipe.(Example: 10 parent items are ordered.  The recipe is that 2 each were originally expected to be shipped per parent quantity. 6 are shipped before the cancel. The cost of the 6 will be prorated among the 10 to be received as they are received.)</td></tr><tr><td>R - Remove Proration. Absorb the full shipped amount with the next receipt.( Example: 10 parent items are ordered.  The recipe is that 2 each were originally expected to be shipped per parent quantity. 6 are shipped before the cancel. The cost of the 6 will be applied with the next receipt, even if only 1 is received.)</td></tr><tr><td></td></tr></table>
